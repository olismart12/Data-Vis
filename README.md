# Data-Vis
This project showcases the creation of interactive dashboards using Power BI to improve decision-making processes. Data integration was performed using SQL and Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. The dashboards provided valuable insights by visualizing large datasets, aiding in government reports and strategies. As well as ontology reporting/graph databases (business and pizza/restuarants)

As well as a D3 Tree & snowflake data vis for geological data: from Geosciences Australia: North Bowen Basin Regional Geology Package: Fluvial & Rock Properties (use of html and python)

# Technologies Used:

Power BI: Tool for creating interactive dashboards.
SQL: Database querying and data integration.
Snowflake: Hosting Data geological data for vis.
HTML: To display geological data.
Python, Pandas, & NumPy: Data processing and analysis libraries.
CSS: To style the Tree
Javascript: To implement the Data Vis
